Greenhouse Goblins is a 2D computer game that was built using Unity as the game engine with coding done in C#. Unity was chosen over competing game engines such as Unreal Engine and MonoGame for reasons discussed further in Chapter 2. The intention of the game is to provide an easy, fun, and accessible way to give basic information to curious players or students about individual-action-based sustainability. A survey was conducted on a group of 14 participants who were asked to fill out a survey before playing the game and results of this survey are provided and analysed in Chapter 2.9. The game’s audience can range from children who are just beginning to learn about sustainability to adults who are making financial decisions in their own homes. It is accessible to individuals with little gaming experience and can be a relaxing playthrough for those that have experience in gaming. By providing a fun and engaging playthrough, the game’s intention is to teach the player how to act more sustainably in real-life through experiences in-game without feeling like a strictly educational game.

The game rewards users’ sustainable actions with visits from “Sustainability Goblins” who bring monetary gifts once the Goblins have been unlocked by the Player. The more sustainable behaviour the player exhibits, the more Goblins that are unlocked, and the more monetary gifts the player can collect. Mysterious emails from the previous tenant of the player’s in-game apartment help drive the narrative and relay relevant information to the player.
